# py3-conversions-reference
examples of various bytes to hex to string to bin conversions for reference
<p>
Because I seem to be not able to remember a conversion for too long I made myself that little cheatsheet on conversions. Feel free to copy or add other conversion examples to the existing list.

  # convert a string into a bytes object<br>
  # convert a bytes object into a string<br>
<code>
  s = 'hack the world'<br>
  b = s.encode('utf-8') <br># other encodings can be used as necessary but I typically use utf-8<br>
  s2 = b.decode('utf-8)<br>
</code></p>
<p>
  # create a bytes object from scratch<br>
<code>
  b = b'hack the world'<br>
  </code>
